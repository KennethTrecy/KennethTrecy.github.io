				Over the years, I have built and handled multiple projects to apply my knowledge. As a consequence, I gain experience to build them, to solve their technical issues, and to improve their technical design if possible. Building them helps me improve my decision-making in future projects and not to take things for granted that look like basic. Indeed, simplicity is hard.
